FleepSharp
==========

A fleep client implemented in c#.  It's really new and really raw but I like the way it is coming along so far.<P>I would love for better programmers than myself to join the effort.  I feel like I have a decent model for implementing the API methods but definitely open to new ideas.  Need manpower to power through and implement all of the methods.
